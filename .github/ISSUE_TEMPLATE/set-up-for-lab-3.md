##Make a copy of your Lab 2 repository:
- Create a new public repository called “sp25-cse110-lab3” on GitHub
- In your local terminal (replace <> with your Lab 2 repo name, without the <>):
cd <lab2-repo-name>
```git push --mirror https://github.com/your_username/sp25-cse110-lab3.git``` OR if you're authenticating with an SSH key, use ```git push --mirror git@github.com:your_username/sp25-cse110-lab3.git```
- Clone the new repository to your local machine
- Publish the new repository through GitHub Pages (DO NOT make your lab 2 repo private until you have received your grade back for it)
- Create a README.md file containing the URL of your new GitHub Pages site. Your GitHub Pages site will be found at <username>.github.io/sp25-cse110-lab3
